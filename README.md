Week 6 Weekend Assignment at The Iron Yard

I used Backbone Models, Collections and Views to build a chat/message app like Twitter. Users can view their profile, as well as edit and delete messages they write. I did not have enough time this weekend to enable users to see other users' profiles. I also didn't have enough time to allow users to flesh out their profiles.
